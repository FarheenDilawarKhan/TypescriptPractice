#Typescript Practice 

*TypeScript is a syntactic sugar for JavaScript*. 

> The TypeScript type system enables programmers to express limits on the capabilities of JavaScript objects, and to use tools that enforce these limits. To minimize the number of annotations needed for tools to become useful, the TypeScript type system makes extensive use of type inference.

 _Have a new look_ :open_mouth:

> TypeScript syntax is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) syntax. Every JavaScript program is also a TypeScript program. The TypeScript compiler performs only file-local transformations on TypeScript programs and does not re-order variables declared in TypeScript. This leads to JavaScript output that closely matches the TypeScript input. TypeScript does not transform variable names, making tractable the direct debugging of emitted JavaScript. TypeScript optionally provides source maps, enabling source-level debugging. TypeScript tools typically emit JavaScript upon file save, preserving the test, edit, refresh cycle commonly used in JavaScript development.

**ECMA script 6** 
  > TypeScript syntax includes all features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), including classes and modules, and provides the ability to translate these features into ECMAScript 3 or 5 compliant code.
